# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Initial project structure with separate `engine` (Rust/WASM) and `frontend` (JavaScript) directories.
- Skeleton modules for engine: `math`, `simulation`, `wasm_bridge`.
- Skeleton modules for frontend: `renderer`, `input`, `ui`.
- i18n locale directory with English default (`locales/en.json`).
- `.gitignore` covering Rust build artifacts, WASM `pkg/` output, and frontend `dist/` and `node_modules`.
- First playable fullscreen browser frontend with a dark grid canvas, start screen, game-over screen, and semi-transparent HUD panels for lives, score, timer, wave, and boid count.
- WASM-facing `GameEngine` bridge that spawns boids, advances the flock, reports collisions, and returns flat position buffers to JavaScript.
- Player-seeking boid steering with unit coverage for the new target-seeking rule and flock update behaviour.
- Keyboard-driven player movement with acceleration, deceleration, and maximum speed.
- Post-update boid overlap resolution so the flock stays spread out instead of collapsing into a single stacked point.
- A local segmented life bar drawn directly beneath the player character.
- Wave progression that spawns additional, harder boid variants with colour tiers.
- Three-second start countdown with initial boids spawned away from the player.
- Boids are now drawn as small arrows that point along their flight direction, so the swarm's movement is readable at a glance.
- Target framerate selector (30, 60, or 120 FPS) in the start menu; the highest option renders as fast as the display allows. The choice is kept for the rest of the session, including restarts.
- Vitest as the frontend test runner (`npm test`, `npm run test:watch` in `frontend/`), configured to
  run in Node so the suite needs neither a browser nor a built WebAssembly package. First covered
  module is the frametime graph's `FrameMetrics`: simulation-time accumulation across undrawn frames,
  ring-buffer wraparound, the peak leaving the window, `summary()` on an empty buffer, and `reset()`.
- Optional frametime graph, switchable in the start menu and drawn in the top-left corner. Each bar is one rendered frame, stacking simulation time (including the WebAssembly boundary) below draw time, with the current frame total, the window's peak, and a dashed line marking the frame budget. The vertical axis follows the selected target framerate, and frames past the top of the scale are capped in red. It measures script work only, not GPU time.

- Start-menu option for the frametime graph's curves: "separate" keeps simulation and draw time as two curves, "combined" plots a single curve for the whole frame.
- A collapsed "Developer Settings" section in the start menu, holding the frametime-graph options.
- Boids from wave three onward can dash at the player. A dash runs in four phases: the boid first
  charges up for about three quarters of a second, then lunges at the position the player stood in
  at the moment of the launch, then flocks normally again, and finally waits out a cooldown before it
  may dash again. Cohesion and alignment are switched off for the duration of the lunge, so a dashing
  boid visibly breaks out of the swarm and is pulled back in by cohesion afterwards; separation stays
  on, so it curves around anything in its path instead of ploughing through it. Only a handful of
  boids may charge or dash at the same time, and the flock hands out a new dash slot only every 40
  simulation steps, so the swarm never turns into a wall of lunges. Later waves warn for a shorter
  time, dash faster and further, and recover quicker.

### Changed
- The frametime graph's vertical axis now follows the selected target framerate instead of the measured load. The dashed line always marks the frame budget of that framerate (16.67 ms at 60 FPS) and sits halfway up the plot, so the free half above it shows by how much a frame missed its budget. The axis therefore holds still for a whole round: the same curve height always means the same cost.
- The frametime graph now draws continuous curves instead of stacked bars, in the style of an external frametime monitor: a thin line over a tinted area, scrolling in from the left while the history fills up.
- The frametime graph's numbers are now averages over the visible window rather than the newest frame alone. Browsers deliberately round `performance.now()` (Firefox to a whole millisecond), so a single frame's cost can only ever be reported as an integer; averaging the window restores the decimal place. The peaks stay raw so spikes remain visible.
- The engine now stores movement and perception tuning as per-boid properties with named defaults, so different boid variants can coexist in the same flock.
- The Copilot instructions now explicitly require heterogeneous boid support instead of assuming one global parameter set for every boid.
- Frontend Vite scripts now build the Rust/WASM package into an ignored frontend import folder before dev/build runs.
- The game loop now runs on a fixed timestep: the simulation always advances 60 logical steps per second and only rendering follows the chosen framerate, so difficulty and player speed no longer depend on the display refresh rate.
- Start-menu settings are now built from a shared option-group module, so every setting renders and behaves identically instead of repeating the markup and selection logic per option.

### Fixed
- The score and in-game timer no longer advance while the browser tab is in the background, which previously handed out score for time in which no boid moved.
